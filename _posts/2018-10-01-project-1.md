What was the project that you were responding to, and how did you think about how to approach doing this? What did you end up with as a final piece? In which ways is your piece different from the original, and which aspects were you focused on changing or replicating? 

I am responding to Numbers Station.

Trying to capture the style of Numbers Station is hard. They are trying to recreate a feeling that a dataset evokes, in attempts to understand our relationship with that dataset through both sonic representations and live performance (reading out numbers). All aspects of their piece were designed to make the audience uncomfortable, because the dataset represented events that are deeply inhumane and still traumatic for many to have to reconcile with. 

I tried to pick a dataset that is difficult to confront, but one that hopefully was not too emotionally charged for people. I thought that it was important for the dataset to be a little challenging, since evoking a happy or benign dataset seems disingenuous to the style of the original piece. I also didn't want to pick a topic that is generally considered troubling for people, since my experience in the performance and sound 

-read out loud a sample "letter of foreclosure" while that shit blares in the background. aaaaugh. inspect element DCX and just have the numbers up there. 

DEFAULTING.
