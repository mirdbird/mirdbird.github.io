What was the project that you were responding to, and how did you think about how to approach doing this? What did you end up with as a final piece? In which ways is your piece different from the original, and which aspects were you focused on changing or replicating? 

Previously, I wrote about _Numbers Station_, a sound and performance art piece created by Mendi and Keith Obadike. In the interest of extending my own appreciation for creating that style of art, I interacted with a dataset intending to emulate the style of _Numbers Station_ (though to admittedly disappointing results).

### _Style_
_Numbers Station_ was a piece that employed both sound and live performance to represent a dataset, and in doing so, engaged its audience with the subject matter of the dataset. It was designed to evoke thoughts and feelings, to inspire metaphors and perhaps a deeper understanding or connection with the data represented. Though there is a nontrivial performance aspect, the primary catalyst for the "evoking of emotion" is sound: the voices of the Obadike's accompanied by ambient tones are the focal point of the piece. It's also worth noting that the only thing explicitly given about their piece is the context for the data; they don't tell you what you should be feeling. In this way, there is a very abstract element that is core to the style.  

To me, emulating the style of _Numbers Station_ would mean creating a sound piece around a dataset that would evoke thoughts, emotions, and feelings in its audience that would help them process it. Furthermore, the sounds should speak for the data, without needing overt signaling to guide the audience to a conclusion.
