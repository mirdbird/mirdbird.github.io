Your homework assignment is to evaluate one of the pieces that we looked at in class and respond by writing a 300-400 word 
review/critique of it. What is the piece trying to do or say? What about the piece appeals to you? What works about it? 
What doesn't work? What could make it stronger, and what is adding to or taking away from its impact? Consider aspects like content, 
form, style, context, etc. Be thorough and thoughtful.

A numbers station is a shortwave radio station used to broadcast encrypted or codified information via formatted numbers over large areas, or long distances. Mendi and Keith Obadike's [_Numbers Series_](http://obadike.squarespace.com/#/numbers-station-series/), comprised of the three performance art and installation pieces _Numbers Station 1 [Furtive Movements]_, _Numbers Station 2 [Red Record]_, and _Numbers Station 3 [Manifests]_, makes use of the radio format to sonify data generated from NYPD Stop and Frisk data, from lynching dates contained in Ida B. Wells' _The Red Record_, and from 18th and 19th century slave ship manifests respectively. For each performance, the source of the data is the sole context for the two readers sitting at at a sparse table, reading off numbers in a robotic monotone into a microphone as mapped digital tones provide background noise. 

It's a difficult performance to engage with. The sonic backdrop to each performance is comprised of harsh digital noise, reminiscent of microphone feedback or dial tones, sounds that typically encourage us to do everything in our power to make them stop. The foreground of sound are the even, monotone voices of the Obadike's, alternating readings of numbers. The overall effect is one that take you back to waiting rooms at the DMV, complete with a building headache
