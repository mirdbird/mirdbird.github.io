A numbers station is a shortwave radio station used to broadcast encrypted or codified information via formatted numbers over large areas, or long distances. Mendi and Keith Obadike's [_Numbers Series_](http://obadike.squarespace.com/#/numbers-station-series/), comprised of the three performance art and installation pieces _Numbers Station 1 [Furtive Movements]_, _Numbers Station 2 [Red Record]_, and _Numbers Station 3 [Manifests]_, makes use of the radio format to sonify data generated from NYPD Stop and Frisk data, from lynching dates contained in Ida B. Wells' _The Red Record_, and from 18th and 19th century slave ship manifests respectively. For each performance, the source of the data is the sole context for the two readers sitting at at a table, reading off numbers into a microphone as mapped digital tones provide background noise. 

It's a difficult performance to engage with. The sonic backdrop to each performance is comprised of sounds reminiscent of microphone feedback or dial tones, sounds that typically encourage us to do everything in our power to make them stop. In the foreground is the even, monotone voices of the Obadikes alternating readings of numbers. Visually, the installation at the Ryan Lee Gallery is sparse. It's a room with white walls, the Obadikes seated across from each other at a table bearing only the equipment they'd need to broadcast over shortwave radio, the lists of formatted numbers, and a reading light. There is no seating for the audience, who crowds along the walls of the room. The overall effect is closest to a more intense version of experiences most often associated with waiting rooms at the DMV, complete with a budding headache, a sense of discomfort, and itch of impatience. But this is the feeling the Obadike's are exploring, are coming to terms with, are forcing their audience to confront. 

What is the source of this headache, discomfort, this impatience? At its core, the Obadike's performance, along with any frustrating visits to the DMV, is unsettling because of how dehumanizing the experience is. Something in us protests at the idea of people being flattened into a number: a resistance towards being made unsympathetic and cold, individually insignificant, just another member of an infinite set. But perhaps most critically, the feeling stems from the fact that it is two people acting with the capacity of machines. _Numbers Station_ is not given the voice of a Siri or an Alexa, not given the voice of a computer attempting humanness. It is given the very human voices of the Obadikes simulating that of an unflinching machine. We do not expect our computers to understand our experiences, but we all hope that other people will express empathy towards us, especially towards our most traumatizing moments. It is here that the context of the data hits in full force. The Obadikes are not just reading out any numbers. They are reading out numbers into which are encoded unquantifiable amounts of human pain.
