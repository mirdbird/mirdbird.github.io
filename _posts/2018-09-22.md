If all data is interpreted, as Kurgan (and some of you) say, what are datasets really tell us? How do we know when and how we can trust a dataset, and is there a standard rule for this?
What are the different types of truth that a dataset can have? Can data reflect a number of different realities at once?

Datasets tell us what we are capable of interpreting. How do we know when and how we can trust anything? I mean, in the grand scheme of things, everything is data. How do we trust information we receive, ever? It always comes down to a decision. Pretending that decision isn't there is unhealthy. How can we even trust our own reality is the true reality? Plato's _Allegory of the Cave_ is famous for highlighting the idea of perceived reality. The standard rule for this is your own best judgment. In mathematical proofs, it is the same. We aim for a common shared structure, and we do so by placing down axioms or ground rules, just to align everyone's sight. We work through proofs by first defining things, unambiguously. We trust that we share that common understanding.

To trust a dataset, do you trust where the data comes from? Do you share a common understanding with the data? Do you know how the data was collected? Do you trust that the data being shown is not altered? There is no standard rule. As with all other actions in life, a decision must be made.

A dataset can reflect any number of truths. Suppose a dataset represents an idea. Plato has a theory of forms, and absolutely can reflect a number of different realities at once. The data does not come from an impossible perspective, even though it may try to simulate one. Even if it did, the data is of no use to us until someone looks at it. In this case, when the tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it fall, we really can't ever be sure that there was a sound. To even attempt to reflect reality, data must be looked at from a perspective. A mountain must be looked at from a perspective, and may look very different from one point of view to another. A mid-sized novel may look a daunting task to someone who has just learned to read, but to a college student, may look like a quiet night of reading. Of course data can represent any number of realities.
