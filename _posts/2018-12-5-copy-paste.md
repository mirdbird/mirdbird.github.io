Continuing from the last post, I decided to go with the second sketch idea because that was the image I couldn't get out of my head. It felt right somehow, but as I worked on it, there was something crucial missing, especially with tie-ins to how I felt about algorithms, automation, and AI. Though that topic certainly inspired the drawing, it did not quite convey what I wanted it to. 

It's worth noting that the initial sketch is still very much a work in progress, but I started messing around with the image in photoshop to see what I should add to make this feel more complete, or at least closer to what I am trying to achieve with the piece. 

What is it exactly that I'm trying to achieve with the piece? Last time in class, I received feedback that agreed with the sentiment that it just didn't exactly connect back to the triple A's (automation, AI, algorithms). My point there was that we create these technologies in the image of ourselves, but they are at a point that which they start to inform how we think of ourselves as well. It has now very much become a two-way street. 

Here is the (unfinished) concept piece. I decided to make one side look more like me (and sort of "complete", though both are unfinished so this effect is largely lost), though both mirror the actions being performed on one another. I want to be careful here; I don't think that not having certain features makes anything more or less of a person, but I also want to get across that one side is less authentic? less fully human? than the other. Perhaps this is not the best way to achieve that. Still working on this, though I think this is pretty effective in some ways. I also felt that the idea of a physical mirror or monitor seemed...cheap, somehow, so I removed that.

Then I started messing around in Photoshop, kind of to inform where I should go next. These are quite rushed jobs, so there is some sloppy edit work here, but that's fine because none of these are final. Again, I am using them to kind of gauge where I should move next with my piece.

I also want to note that I didn't steal any artwork here; I just pulled a bunch of other things I've drawn before. No art theft here. 

This first one is informed by how empty the space around my drawing is; there is a lot of blank space that I don't want, so I first sought out to eliminate that. I wasn't sure what to fill the space with, so I picked something that was visually very busy and set to work with an eraser tool. I kind of like this concept, where half is surrounded by an image that the other begins to fill with. I wonder if I could take this in a direction where one side has one distinct abstract pattern and the other has another, and they start to "apply" those patterns to one another. These patterns, like the image below, would be drawn from the environment, but each would be filled with the respective environment of the other. I think visually that's more stimulating and gets closer to what I want to achieve with the piece.

In this second one, I wanted more asymmetry; it's not that I want to put several of the same image in various sizes, but I thought about overlay layers and objects of different sizes. I kind of like that they're all self-portraits of myself, and I think it would actually be interesting if one side sort of implied it was copy-pasting versions of myself onto the other. Though I'm not sure what the reverse interaction would be here, I like the composition of this better than the first one. I still have a ways to go to achieve the triple A connection though.

This is probably overdone in the copy-paste department, but actually it sort of gets at what I wanted to achieve with iteration. I wonder if I could play with this idea, perhaps give another image that could be inverted and reverted several times to show a progression of technology. I want to be careful with this though, because I'm trying to be careful about drawing straight-up tech. I want to be especially cautious of drawing a machine-like human with sort of robot looking parts, because there are people that actually use prosthetics, and that isn't really the message I'm trying to get across. Though I think there are interesting intersections between that idea and the triple-A's, I'm also nervous about representing that sort of identity, which is something I have very little experience with.

Either way, I have a lot more work to do, first of which is to make the source image more complete. I like the idea of photoshopping and collaging some images together, because that saves me a lot of time (which I am unfortunately quite short on) and also feels more true to my own art style. I also think this sort of thing will help me better achieve what I am trying to.
