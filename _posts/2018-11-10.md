## Technology Telling us Who We Are
This is uncomfortable. I don't want to be defined by generalities, by the categories I fit into. Many stereotypes hurt because we are being judged without having someone assess our actual character. It makes us feel cheap, and blurs our own sense of identity. The way machine learning directs our algorithms simply implements this on a mass scale. 
Of course to process massive quantities of information, everybody is just shrunk down to a statistical point, one amongst billions. There is not enough time or capacity to see everyone as a person, so we become abstractions of ourselves, defined by the categories I fit into. Some embrace judgment, because they know they will be judged favorably. They believe in the system and the values it is defined by. Others, historically betrayed by this overarching system, are not so keen. 

## Using Technology to Find Ourselves
what do AI, social algorithms, and automation tell us about ourselves?
