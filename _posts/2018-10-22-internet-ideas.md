These are a few ideas related to the internet that I found interesting.

## Hikikomori
[Hikikomori: "pulling inward, being confined"](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2018/february/japan-hikikomori-isolation-society/), a photo series by Maika Elan for National Geographic.

The internet is cited as one of the reasons for a substantial number of young adults, primarily men, in Japan who are basically shut-ins, not leaving their rooms for years at a time. They have withdrawn from society. I think this power of the internet to socially isolate people in their offline lives is pretty interesting, since they seem to have their connections to society solely through the internet. It's a different sort of connection, I think, and judging by the "nurses" who slowly try to get them out of their rooms, I think there is something different about offline and online connections for them as well.

## Fake News and the News Algorithm
[How to Fix Fake News](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/opinion/facebook-fake-news-philosophy.html), an opinion article by Regina Rini for the New York Times.

[How to Fix The Fake News Problem](https://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/opinions/how-to-fix-the-fake-news-problem-hughes/index.html), an opinion article by Brian Hughes for CNN.

[Fixing Fake News](https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-speech/internet-speech/fixing-fake-news), a blog post for ACLU by Jay Stanley. 

[Solving the Problem of Fake News](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/solving-the-problem-of-fake-news), an article by Nicholas Lemann for The New Yorker.

There are many proposed solutions to the Fake News problem that propogates on the internet, since we become the disseminators of information throughout our social circles (and even beyond!). Accountability is hard. Various solutions, such as accountability indicators, higher regulation, curated news by companies, and promotion of public news networks are suggested. All seem to be accepting of the fact that in a communication channel without given leaders or a centralized outlet for news, fake news (and fake news trumping Real News) is inevitable. I think I'd like to explore this is more in the space of the propogation of beliefs and how quickly they can spread through the internet than an examination of the idea of "fake news". 

[At The Border Town the News Cycle Left Behind](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/business/media/border-town-news-cycle-immigrants.html) is an article for the New York Times that briefly touches on how once our internet algorithms and public attention span has worn out, we largely ignore problems that were present in the news. Not drawing attention to something largely makes it seem like it doesn't exist, and in a 24/7 news cycle dominated society, there is too much news to contend with, so many stories are left in the dust. I think there is something powerful here about the internet as an attention-controlling mechanism, and how that affects our mindsets in our day-to-day.

## Balkanization (Splinternet)

[The Fall of the Internet and Rise of the Splinternet](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/03/the-fall-of-the-internet-and-the-rise-of-the-splinternet/37181/), an article for _The Atlantic_.

[Think Again: The Internet](https://foreignpolicy.com/2010/04/26/think-again-the-internet/), an article for Foreign Policy about how the Internet will never be a "Global Village", and is predisposed to being splintered.

[Survey of Government Internet Filtering Practices Indicates Increasing Internet Censorship](https://cyber.harvard.edu/newsroom/first_global_filtering_survey_released)

The main idea of cyber-balkanization is that the internet is going to separate, instead of being one giant global community that connects us all. Something that was built to connect may even be local disconnection, as personalization and individualism that the internet promotes these days has us shrink more in to ourselves.

## Privacy
### Data Breach
[Prime Factors: Future-proofing the Internet](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/10/20/quantum-computers-will-break-the-encryption-that-protects-the-internet), an article for the 10/18/2018 edition of The Economist.
### Regulation and Enforcement
[Why It's So Hard To Punish Companies for Data Breaches](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/opinion/facebook-data-breach-regulation.html), an opinion article 
### Surveillance State

[Shiru Cafe](http://global.shirucafe.com/mission.php), a cafe where students can pay with their personal information instead of money.

All these things seem to have more to do with data collection, but I think that idea is very much tied to the internet, since the internet is one source of our personal data, as well as the distributor of data. 

Overall I am most interested in the internet's influence on connections between people.
