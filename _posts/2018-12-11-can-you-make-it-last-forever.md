### In The Image Of (2018) 
_Pencil on Paper_

We have a relationship with the things we create, not least of which is our technology. These creations are concepted by us, and we express some aspect of ourselves in these conceptions. On some level, they are created in the image of ourselves: they reflect us. We learn more about ourselves from these reflections, and change ourselves accordingly. As we change, so too do our reflections/creations change. 
When we create something, we have a specific image, and impress those specific images and thoughts into our creations. Many of these creations will outlive us; this is a legacy we leave behind, a bid for immortality, something that will speak for us after we are gone.

### About the Work (Process)
My two previous posts detail the early life of this piece. Here, I'll talk about my intent behind various aspects of the piece. 

Above is my artist statement, which gives the underlying "theme" that I tried to communicate with my piece. Again, this idea of creation was inspired by the prompt: AI, Algorithms, and Automation, which are modern technologies that I believe closely reflect human action. These technologies take various human actions, from pattern recognition, performing routine tasks, to transporting ourselves from one place to another, and either mimic or make them better somehow: faster, more efficient. They capture what we believe are important human actions to replicate, and of course, in individual execution, say something about the individual creators behind each technology as well. I think our relationship with technology is very much similar to our relationship with other things we create. In the end, many of these artifacts of creation will go on to tell others about us. 

My work doesn't really reference these specific technologies much: the idea that the topic inspired was more exciting to me to talk about. I gave them a nod in the "dusting" of the Creator figure in the "action" of the piece: that figure is disintegrating into 1's and 0's, the backbone binary action behind our computers (and thus algorithms and AI). These 1's and 0's also what the mirrored figure is composed of: there is a transfer of information between the two, that goes beyond just a reflection. (A not-so-secret-secret: the dusting idea mostly came from the need to bring the piece together from a composition standpoint: the left side of the image was looking pretty empty and disconnected from the right side, and a pattern kind of helps to tie the piece together better.)

The four images of myself that are overlaying (and honestly kind of dominating the main image) are selfies. They are taken at slightly different angles, with slightly different perspectives, but I didn't take those selfies for the project; they were just pulled from photos I had on my phone. They are my drawing interpretation of photographs, not all very photoaccurate, and further blurred by the overlay. Nonetheless, these are the images of myself that I wanted to preserve through drawing, and the photographs were already footprints of my vanity, wanting to preserve a certain image of myself. Depending on the angle of the camera, these can look like different people, but they are four different views that I chose to preserve. In the image, these are the images from which the creation is being created in the image of. These are a more "meta" part of the drawing: these are the results of the action of the piece from my standpoint: I am literally recreating images of myself in an interpretation of myself. But within the context of the piece, these again are the source ideas and images from which the person is creating something. It kind of all fits together in this way.
