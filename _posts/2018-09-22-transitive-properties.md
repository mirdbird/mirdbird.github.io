If a tree falls in a forest but no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?

If a set of numbers has no meaningful interpretation to anyone, is it still data?

The way we interact with the world around us, with our personal realities, is largely dependent on how and what we perceive. The information we receive from our senses shapes our realities, and what is a dataset if not a captured perception? 

In Plato's _Allegory of the Cave_, a group of people are raised in a cave, with only an unseen fire casting shadows of the outside world on the back of a cave wall. This is all they are allowed to perceive; this is their reality. Their personal datasets, received from all of their senses, tell them that this is what the world is: flickering shadows. A rabbit would be only the shadow of a rabbit. After all, their their data said so. They have no reason to believe otherwise. If one person was taken out of the cave, the new light and perspective would be blinding and overwhelming, not to mention a serious "update" to their mental datasets. Their entire take on reality would change. 

So how do we know when and how we can trust anything we perceive? It always comes down to a decision. The standard rule for this is your own best judgment. The more informed you are about the dataset's context, and the more encompassing your dataset is, the more confidence you can place in your ability to interpret the information you have. Do you know what your light source is? Where it comes from? 

A dataset can reflect any number of truths. The data does not come from an impossible perspective, even though it may try to simulate one. Even if it did, the data is of no use to us until someone looks at it. In this case, when the tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it fall, we really can't ever be sure that there was a sound. To even attempt to reflect reality, data must be looked at, and the gaze of the viewer comes from somewhere. It has to. And the viewer is ultimately the person who decides what the truth of the dataset is..to them. It may align with others' perceptions of the truth, or it may not, but it's hard to say who's truth is more true. That again, is to the discretion of each individual.

In this way, data can be thought of how we generally think of art. We attribute subjective truth to art. Some artists even say that once they put an art piece out into the world, it is no longer theirs; it is everything that their audience wants it to be. We attach many, all valid, personal truths to art, and sum it up in colloquialisms like "beauty is in the eye of the beholder". 

It's also often said that "art imitates life". So too, does data imitate life. So maybe thinking about data as "objective" is a lost cause; it functions very similarly to art, as frightening as that may sound. There is so much choice in taking data, whether we like to admit it or not. It is not a view from nowhere. It's more an art.

Just like there is good art, there is certainly good data. We should take this into consideration, putting as much care into collecting our data as an artist would in creating a piece. "Good" art often feels like it's hit on something deeper, tapped into some divine, perhaps universal, truth. There's no reason good data shouldn't be able to do the same.
