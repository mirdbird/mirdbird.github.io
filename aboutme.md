Hello! I'm Miranda, currently a student enrolled in Creative Approaches to Emerging Technologies, led by Creative-in-Residence Mimi Onuoha at Olin College of Engineering.

I plan to graduate in May 2020 with a B.S. in General Engineering with a Concentration in Mathematics. I grew up in Southern California, but moved to Northern Virginia after graduating high school. I now attend school in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts.

My favorite cereal is Corn Pops.
